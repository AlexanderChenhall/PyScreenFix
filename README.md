This is an effort from a beginner coder (Me) to create a fullscreen implementation of the popular web app JScreenFix, which floods a portion of the screen with randomly
generated pixels of varying colors in an attempt to reactivate stuck pixels.

P.S: Morrowen is also me, but i don't know how to stop commiting as that account on my main PC ):
